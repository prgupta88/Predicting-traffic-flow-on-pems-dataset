# Predicting-traffic-flow-on-pems-dataset

Accurate and convenient traffic flow data is important for the effective arrangement of smart transportation frameworks. In the last three decades, traffic data have been flooded, and we have genuinely entered in the time of big data information for transportation. Existing traffic flow forecast techniques for the most part utilize shallow traffic expectation models which are yet unsuitable for some real time applications. This circumstance motivates us to reconsider the traffic stream expectation issue dependent on profound engineering models with huge traffic information and seeing the problem from different perspective. In this report, we will present the various approaches follows so far for solving the problem. For example, statistical and machine learning based model, comparing the problem to fluid mechanics and applying hidden Fluid mechanism based deep learning model. This HFM is exceptionally adaptable in picking the spatio-temporal data information and further in training and prediction. Some other approaches were studied and explored in the course of time and are documented.
